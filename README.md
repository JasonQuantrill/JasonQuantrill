Hi, I’m @JasonQuantrill, third year Computer Science Co-op student at TMU.
I’m interested in designing software and robotics to help people. I'm especially interested in how AI applications can change the world in a positive direction.
I’m currently looking to generally improve my coding skills. Specifically, I've currently focused my learning on ML applications in Python.
I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting project, specifically involving AI and neural networks.
You can reach me by emailing me at jason.quantrill@torontomu.ca or messaging me on LinkedIn http://www.linkedin.com/in/JasonQuantrill.
