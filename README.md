Hi, I’m @JasonQuantrill
I’m interested in designing software and robotics to help people. I'm especially interested in how AI applications can change the world in a positive direction.
I’m currently looking to generally improve my coding skills. Specifically, I'm currently learning Robot Operating System (ROS), Bash, and C. I'm also learning several maths, including Linear Algebra and Probability & Statistics.
I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting project, specifically involving AI and neural networks.
You can reach me by emailing me at jason.quantrill@ryerson.ca or messaging me on LinkedIn http://www.linkedin.com/in/JasonQuantrill.
