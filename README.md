Hi, I’m @JasonQuantrill, fourth year Computer Science student at TMU.
I’m interested in designing software and robotics to help people. I'm especially interested in the potential of software and AI applications to revolutionize industries.
I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting project, specifically involving AI, ML, and neural networks.
You can reach me by emailing me at jason.quantrill@torontomu.ca or messaging me on LinkedIn http://www.linkedin.com/in/JasonQuantrill.
